### Name : senthilkumaran  
### Reg.No : 212223220103
## AIM:
To capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark in order to observe protocols, packets, and potential anomalies.

## DESIGN STEPS:
### Step 1:
Install Wireshark using the command:

### Step 2:
Launch Wireshark and select the appropriate network interface for live traffic capture.

### Step 3:
Start the capture, apply filters (like http, tcp, ip.addr == x.x.x.x) to analyze specific traffic, and stop the capture after observing relevant data.

## PROGRAM:
Wireshark Packet Capture and Filter Usage

## OUTPUT:
- Captured Packets with Protocol Analysis and Detailed Packet Info

- ## Apply Filters to Focus on Specific Traffic
• Use filters like http, ip.addr == 192.168.1.1, or tcp.port == 80 in the top filter bar to narrow down results.
